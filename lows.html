    <h2>Governments & Laws: The Rules That Shape the World</h2>
    <p>
      From ancient kingdoms to modern democracies, the way humans organize power has always told a story.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
      Today, every country operates under its own <strong>form of government</strong> — systems that determine <em>who leads, how decisions are made, and how rights are protected</em> (or not).
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="400">
      Some countries elect leaders through free votes. Others are ruled by monarchs, military powers, or single-party systems. No two governments are exactly alike — yet each has profound influence on its people’s lives.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="600">
      <strong>Laws</strong> are the written rules that govern behavior — defining what’s allowed, what’s forbidden, and how justice is served. Some are centuries old, rooted in tradition. Others evolve rapidly, shaped by changing values, technology, and global events.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="800">
      Across the globe, laws differ dramatically.<br>
      In one nation, protesting is a right; in another, it’s a crime.<br>
      In one, marriage laws welcome all; in another, they exclude or punish.<br>
      Even driving rules, drinking ages, or internet access can vary wildly.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1000">
      Yet despite their differences, governments and laws share one goal: to provide <span class="highlight">structure</span>.<br>
      At their best, they protect freedoms, ensure fairness, and promote peace.<br>
      At their worst, they control, divide, or suppress.
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1200">
      To understand a country — really understand it — you must look at its laws and how it governs.  
    </p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="1400" class="tagline">
      KnowTerra explores more than flags and maps — we uncover how nations function, lead, and evolve.
